# Alive Camera
This CameraScript adds a subtle "looking around" effect to a static camera, giving the impression of a person's head moving slightly. It also includes a gentle breathing effect applied to the camera for "realism" 

For the script to work just add a Camera3D node to the scene, apply the CameraScript to the camera and voila it should work.

# Known Issue
For some reason the camera will spaz in and out at the start for the breathing but then sticks to the sin wave. I could try fixing the code but it's not noticeable for my project
